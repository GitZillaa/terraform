SVG is an XML language, similar to XHTML, 
which can be used to draw vector graphics,
such as the one shown below. It can be used 
to create an image either by specifying all the 
lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already 
existing raster images, or by a combination of both.
The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together,
or filtered to change their appearance completely.
